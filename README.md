## Abstract

In robotics, perception is usually oriented at understanding what is happening in the external world, while few works pay attention to what is occurring in the robot's body. In this work, we propose an artificial somatosensory system,  embedded in a cognitive architecture, that enables a robot to perceive the sensations from its embodiment while executing a task. We called these perception \emph{roboceptions} and they let the robot act according to its own physical needs in addition to the task demands. Physical information is processed by the robot to behave in a balanced way, determining the most appropriate trade-off between the achievement of the task and its well-being. The experiments show the integration of information from the somatosensory system and the choices that lead to the accomplishment of the task.
